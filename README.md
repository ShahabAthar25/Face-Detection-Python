<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is made in **cv2** and is a **Computer Vision** project. I am trying to become a computer vision expert and taking one step at a time in the right direction.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

This project is built with **cv2** which is a great library for python and used in computer vision. Be sure to check them out.

- [opencv-python](https://opencv.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This Project Uses **Python**. Before getting started make sure that you have the Prerequisites. Good luck on your journey.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- pip
  ```sh
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ShahabAthar25/Face-Detection-Python
   ```
2. Install cv2
   ```sh
   # For Windows Users
   pip install opencv-python
   # For Linux Or Mac Users
   sudo pip install opencv-python
   ```
3. Run The Project
   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Opencv is the biggest library for computer vision. it is used in face recognition, detecting objects and much more!!!

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)_
